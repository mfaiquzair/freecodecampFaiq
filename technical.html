                    Intro is on Faiq. The person who are responsible for
                    developing this. He is a Computer Science student 
                    at UMP majoring in graphic & multimedia 
                    technology
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the second p element. I honestly don't know
                    what to write in this technical documentation. I 
                    just write random stuff. <code>Faiq Uzair</code>
                </p>
                <h4>Faiq's List</h4>

            <p>Fun fact, Faiq does not want to pursue his
                studies in this field. But, Allah is the greatest
                planner.
            </p>
            <p>
                So after I get into the course, I was still in denial
                until the end of my 2nd year study. Starts from sem1 3rd
                year. I start to focus on subjects to fix my CPA a little
                even though it is <code>beyond</code> repair. HAHAHA

            <p>Faiq likes to read. He likes it since primary school.
                He get this shit based on his family members'
                interest in reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book that hooked him on is Harry Potter. To be
                exact, <code>HP Series</code> by JK Rowling.
                Now, his reading materials has been widen by various
                genres.

                Faiq learns to truly play music in in secondary
                school. He play <code>trombone</code>. However,
                he also could play euphonium, trumpet,saxophone
                and clarinet.

                if combined.

            <p>
                Hello world was my first step in<code>front-end</code>
                development. With that comes the interest 
                and eagerness to learn until...
            </p>
            <p>
                ...until I learn more on it..HAHAHAHHAAH..So Faiq, 
                keep going. You can do it. Eventhough it is technically
                you advising you, listen. <code>Just Do It!</code>
